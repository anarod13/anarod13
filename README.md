### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Ana RodrÃ­guez, a Software Developer living in Argentina ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·

I jumped into Software Developer about 2 years ago. I started working as a Front-end Developer, but along the way I've been  leaning towards back-end, so lately I've been focusing on writing performative, strong and maintainable code, by strengthening my knowledge in SOLID principals and Design Patterns.
